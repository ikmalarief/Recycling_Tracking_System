# Recycling_Tracking_System

The Recycling Tracking System is a web-based application designed to provide a comprehensive solution for tracking and monitoring the recycling practices of an organization or community. The system is built using the MERN (Mongoose, Express, React, Node) stack, with additional tools such as Material UI for styling, Nivo for charts, and Redux Toolkit for state management. Axios is used for handling HTTP requests to ensure seamless communication between the client and server. 

The system is designed with multiple access levels, including admin, staff, and community members, to cater to the needs of different user groups. Users can create and manage their accounts, view their recycling history and progress, access educational materials, and participate in gamification techniques to encourage recycling. The system generates automated notifications to remind users about recycling targets and deadlines and provides data visualization and analytics features to help staff identify areas for improvement. 

Staff can input and update recycling data, track and monitor the recycling progress of members, and generate custom reports for stakeholders. The system includes social media integration features to enable users to share their recycling achievements on social media platforms and a feedback mechanism to gather user feedback and suggestions for improvement. 

The Recycling Tracking System is designed to be scalable and adaptable to cater to future changes in the recycling practices of the organization or community. It provides user training and support to ensure users can use the system effectively and comply with relevant data protection regulations to ensure data privacy. The system is an essential tool for promoting sustainable waste management practices and driving positive change towards a greener future.
